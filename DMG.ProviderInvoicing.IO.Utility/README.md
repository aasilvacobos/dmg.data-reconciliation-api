# IO.Utility

## Purpose

The IO.Utility project contains common I/O-related functionality that can be used by **more than one** IO project. Since this is an IO project, it is expected to be performing I/O and is thus non-deterministic.

The initial purpose is for common RPC functionality, since it will be usable by the current 4 RPC projects. In the future, it might contain common Postgres functionality if practical.
